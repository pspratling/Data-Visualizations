This repository is a collection of data visualizations and animations, created mostly with Python.

Visualizing the expansion of Metro Atlanta since 1980 via the increasing population densities of Georgia counties.

Data gathered from [US Census information](https://www.census.gov/).
Note: Code in the repository is for the interactive bokeh dashboard in the second image, not for the animation. Functionality includes a slider for changing the year, mousewheel zoom,  a hovertool to display county information, and a pan tool.

[Monte Carlo Estimation of Pi](https://github.com/pspratling/Data-Visualizations/tree/master/Monte%20Carlo%20Estimation%20of%20Pi)

Approximating the value of pi using the [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method). Points are generated randomly within the unit square, and the ratio of those that fall within the unit circle to the total number generated is used to approximate the value of pi. As the number of points generated approaches infinity, the approximation converges to the true value of pi.
